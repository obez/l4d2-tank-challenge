Tank Challenge has four maps:
* l4d2_tank_challenge
* l4d2_tank_challenge_15_rounds
* l4d2_tank_challenge_20_rounds
* l4d2_tank_challenge_30_rounds

All the maps share the same design/structure.

Only `l4d2_tank_challenge.vmf` is included here, the other `.vmf` files are created by copy by the python compile script.

They must be compiled separately as the compiled `.bsp` file contains info/paths relative to the name of the file.
